# 🤝 Skill Swap Platform

## 📝 Problem Statement

**Skill Swap Platform** is a mini-application designed to connect individuals who are willing to exchange skills with one another.

The platform promotes collaborative learning and mutual growth through skill sharing.

### 🔍 Overview

This application allows users to:

- Create a profile with basic info (name, location, optional photo)
- List skills they **offer** and skills they **want**
- Set their **availability** (e.g., weekends, evenings)
- Set profile visibility: **Public or Private**
- **Browse or search** other users by skills like "Photoshop" or "Excel"
- **Request and accept/reject swaps**
- **Manage swap requests** – view current and pending requests
- **Rate or leave feedback** after a completed swap
- **Delete swap requests** that are not accepted
